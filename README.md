# AI-Agentic-App-with-ML-Models
We are building an AI Agentic App that has extensive ML models. We have built the MVP, which is now in production and has proven to be successful.

However, there is still work to be done.  We are now building a fully workable product (this phase is kicking off now) which is the focus for Dec and Q1 2025

Your role will be required to be hands-on in the entire AI architecture build and testing. You will also work with- two junior ML engineers, a senior data scientist, and a senior data engineer.

What is expected?
I am looking for someone who can spend at least 20-30 hours per week focussing on the architecture buildout of AI applications with agentic capability, experimentation and research.

You must have:
- Built AI agents and workflows
- Have ML / Production experience
- Launched products in the past
- Built APIs
================
To help you design and build an AI Agentic App with extensive ML models, we need to set up the architecture, build agent workflows, integrate machine learning models, and handle testing. Below is an outline and a Python-based implementation for key components like architecture design, API creation, and AI model integration.
Architecture Overview

The architecture for an AI Agentic App typically involves several key components:

    ML Model Integration: Import and train models (e.g., using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
    API Layer: Expose functionality to interact with the ML models.
    Agentic Workflows: Design workflows to allow the AI agents to interact and perform tasks autonomously.
    Testing Framework: Implement tests to verify the functionality of ML models and agent workflows.

Here's a high-level architecture:

    Frontend: User interfaces (could be built with frameworks like Flask, Django for Python, React, etc.).
    Backend: API services (using Flask/Django or FastAPI) that host ML models and manage workflows.
    ML Models: Trained models using libraries like scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
    Agent Framework: A system (potentially built with Rasa or Dialogflow) that makes decisions based on input data.
    Database: A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data, training logs, and agent interactions.

Example Python Code Implementation

Let’s assume you are working on a product that uses a machine learning model for predictions and an AI agent that responds to user inputs or actions.
Step 1: Build a Simple Machine Learning Model

This Python snippet uses scikit-learn to build a simple predictive model. In your case, this can be replaced with more advanced models depending on your use case.

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import pickle

# Load data and prepare the dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a simple Random Forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%')

# Save the model
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as model_file:
    pickle.dump(model, model_file)

Explanation:

    We load a sample dataset (Iris dataset) and split it into training and testing sets.
    A Random Forest classifier is trained to predict the species of flowers based on the dataset.
    The trained model is saved to a file (model.pkl) using Pickle, which is necessary for model deployment.

Step 2: Build an API for Model Interaction

Using FastAPI (a Python framework) to expose the model for real-time use:

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as model_file:
    model = pickle.load(model_file)

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Define the prediction endpoint
@app.post("/predict/")
def predict(features: list):
    # Convert the input features into numpy array
    features = np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)
    
    # Make a prediction using the loaded model
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    
    return {"prediction": int(prediction[0])}

# Test API with example input (e.g., POST request with flower data)

Explanation:

    FastAPI will allow you to create a web API to handle prediction requests.
    The /predict/ endpoint takes a list of feature values and returns a prediction based on the ML model.
    Once the API is running, users can send POST requests with their data and get predictions.

Step 3: Build an AI Agent Workflow (using Rasa or Dialogflow)

You may need an agent system that interprets user inputs and makes decisions. Here's a very simple Rasa setup for an AI agent.

    Install Rasa:

    pip install rasa

    Define a simple Rasa agent in the following way:

# domain.yml (Defines intents and actions)
intents:
  - greet
  - goodbye
  - ask_predict

actions:
  - action_predict

responses:
  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
  utter_goodbye:
    - text: "Goodbye! Have a great day."
  utter_predict:
    - text: "I can predict something for you. Please provide the input values."

# stories.yml (Defines conversational flow)
stories:
  - story: greet and predict
    steps:
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet
      - intent: ask_predict
      - action: action_predict

    Implement the custom action (i.e., action_predict) in actions.py:

from rasa_sdk import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet
import requests

class ActionPredict(Action):
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "action_predict"

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        # Here, you would call your model API endpoint for prediction
        user_input = tracker.latest_message['text']  # Fetch user input
        
        # For simplicity, we assume the user input is a list of features (change as per your model)
        prediction = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict/", json={"features": [user_input]})
        result = prediction.json()

        dispatcher.utter_message(f"The prediction result is: {result['prediction']}")
        return []

Explanation:

    Rasa is set up to handle conversational workflows.
    action_predict is a custom action that sends a request to your prediction API and returns the model result to the user.

Step 4: Testing & Experimentation

You’ll need to set up continuous integration and testing pipelines. For example, using PyTest for testing ML models, API endpoints, and agent actions.

import pytest
import requests

# Unit Test for the prediction API
def test_predict_api():
    # Example input
    input_data = {"features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}  # Sample flower data

    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict/", json=input_data)
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert 'prediction' in response.json()

Explanation:

    The test_predict_api() function makes sure the prediction API is working by sending it test data and verifying the output.

Wrapping Up

    AI Workflow: Your system will involve both an ML model for predictions and an AI agent to handle interaction.
    Architecture: We created an API to serve predictions and integrated it with a chatbot framework (e.g., Rasa) to build agent workflows.
    Testing: We used testing tools to ensure the system is working as expected.

Next Steps:

    Scalability: Ensure the architecture scales effectively for production workloads. Consider deploying your model and APIs using platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
    Agent Workflow Refinement: Experiment and build more complex workflows for handling various use cases.
    Integration: Continuously integrate and test the entire AI agentic platform with data sources, workflows, and APIs.

This approach provides a modular architecture for building scalable AI-powered applications and agent-based systems for real-time use.
